## Project Development Phase - **Sprint 3**

### Submission files details

- ML Parkinson's Disease model files

> It contains two machine learning model files which was saved using pickle framework from the machine learning workspace called as (.ipynb) notebook. It will be deployed into the web application for the machine learning to automate the tasks as requested by the user.
 
 The machine learning modle files are : 
 
                    - Parkinson_MLmodel.sav
                    - standardScaler.sav

- Machine Learning Algorithm

> It contains python code for building the machine learning model using machine learning algorithms as starting from Data preprocessing , Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to Data mining and saving the model using pickle.
